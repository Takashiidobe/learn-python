# Getting Started

This is a site for python practice -- a REPL is integrated with the site so you can test out code as you learn new concepts.

Every chapter features some lessons and challenges to help you learn python.

This is a Work in Progress, so there aren't too many lessons as of now, but I hope to add to this project little by little.
