# Basic Operations

Python is a high-level language with plenty of features to keep our programs short and easy to write.

We start off by learning about `expressions`, which consist of `values` and `operators`.

Head over to the right hand side of the trinket app and type in `2 + 2`, and then hit enter.

You should see something similar to this:
```bash
>>> 2 + 2
4
```

This is our first expression -- `2 + 2 = 4`.

| Operator | Operation         | Example | Turns into...   |
|----------|-------------------|---------|-----------------|
| **       | Exponent          | 2 ** 3  | 8               |
| %        | Modulus/remainder | 22 % 8  | 6               |
| //       | Integer Division  | 22 // 8 | 2               |
| /        | Division          | 22 / 8  | 2.75            |
| *        | Multiplication    | 3 * 5   | 15              |
| -        | Subtraction       | 5 - 2   | 3               |
| +        | Addition          | 2 + 2   | 4               |

Feel free to enter these test values or others into the console below to get a hang for what the operators do.

Now, before you move on, use each operation at least once to return the answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

When you're done, enter them into the console to see if you were correct.
