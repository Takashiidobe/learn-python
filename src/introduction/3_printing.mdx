# Printing

We're finally going to write our first program. It uses a function, which is a kind of mini-program that captures reusable logic. In our case, our program is going to say "Hello world!", and nothing more.

Inside the REPL below, write `print("Hello world!")` on the left hand side, and click the green play button.

print() is going to print whatever is between its two parentheses to the screen.

<Repl />

You should see something like this:

```bash
> "Hello world!"
```

You've done it! Your first program.

Print is a useful function, as it lets us print lots of kinds of data.

Before moving onto the next section, try printing the other data types we learned to the screen, like integers and floats.
