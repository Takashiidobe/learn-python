# Challenges

Finally we've reached the end of the introduction, and into the first section of challenges.

Prepare yourself: These challenges are going to be hard.
Don't be discouraged if these challenges take you a few days to complete: they certainly took me longer when I was first learning to code.

But I'll give you a tip for these problems: look them up online if you're stuck. Try to formulate the problem into its smallest parts and look up how to do those small parts. That'll help you when trying to solve these problems.

Without further ado!

1. Create a function that translates the temperature from fahrenheit to celcius, so we Americans can understand the temperature.
  - Remember that the formula for translating fahrenheit to celcius is (`temperature in fahrenheit` / 1.8) + 32.
  - Wrap that in a function that takes input and return the celcius temperature.

2. Create a function that determines if a number is odd or even.
- Remember that an even number is cleanly divisible by 2 (that is, there is no remainder when divided by 2).
- An odd number has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.

3. Create a function that takes 3 arguments. A first number, a second number, and an operation which is one of "add", "subtract", "multiply", or "divide", and returns the result of that operation on the numbers.
- If I provide the numbers 1 and 2 and the string "add" for the last argument, I expect the function to return to me the answer 3.
