# Basic Operations

Python is a high-level language with plenty of features to keep our programs short and easy to write.

We'll start off by learning about `expressions`, which consist of `values` and `operators`.

Head over to the right hand side of the REPL and type in `2 + 2`, and then hit enter.

{{< repl >}}{{< /repl >}}

You should see something similar to this:
```bash
> 2 + 2
4
```

This is our first expression -- `2 + 2 = 4`.

Python supports more operators, as shown in the table below.

| Operator | Operation         | Example | Turns into...   |
|----------|-------------------|---------|-----------------|
| **       | Exponent          | 2 ** 3  | 8               |
| %        | Modulus/remainder | 22 % 8  | 6               |
| //       | Integer Division  | 22 // 8 | 2               |
| /        | Division          | 22 / 8  | 2.75            |
| *        | Multiplication    | 3 * 5   | 15              |
| -        | Subtraction       | 5 - 2   | 3               |
| +        | Addition          | 2 + 2   | 4               |

Feel free to enter these test values or others into the console below to get a hang for what the operators do.

{{< repl >}}{{< /repl >}}

Now, before you move on, use each operation at least once to return the answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

When you're done, enter them into the console to see if you were correct.
I'll leave my answers in the little box you can click called "Answers"

{{< answer >}}
2 ** 1 # 1
5 % 3 # 2
10 // 3 # 3
16 / 4 # 4
5 * 1 # 5
9 - 3 # 6
4 + 3 # 7
